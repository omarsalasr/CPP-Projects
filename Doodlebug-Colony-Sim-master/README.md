# CPP-Doodlebug-Colony-Sim
Colony simulation of doodlebugs (predators) and ants (prey).

This program is a simulation that creates 2 types of bugs and goes through several days simulating the movement, eating, death, and birth of each one. This is done by utilizing a timer and C++ classes with inheritence.

Terminal Compelation: make

Execution: ./osalas3Proj7 -d <int>
  
The integer indicates the miliseconds of delay between each day in the simulation.

Output: Location of each bug in the grid on a given day
